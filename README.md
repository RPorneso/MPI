This is a practice exercise using the dataset https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.b8gtht7bh where actigraphy data was collected from individuals with chronic insomnia (n=40) and their healthy bed partners (n=40). C1045 and P1045 were used to build the codes and C1057/P1057 and C1182/P1182 were used to test them. The data were collected using Respironics Actiwatch Spectrum Pro and Actiware software (Respironics, Bend, OR, USA), with movement counts sampled in 60-second epochs. In addition to movement, light exposure (on the wrist) was also recorded.

The codes in this repository are all custom-made. Please ask for permission when using them. Thank you!
