This is a practice exercise using the dataset https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.b8gtht7bh where actigraphy data was collected from individuals with chronic insomnia and their healthy partners (n_insomnia = 40, n_control = 40). The data were collected using Respironics Actiwatch Spectrum Pro and Actiware software (Respironics, Bend, OR, USA), with movement counts sampled in 60-second epochs. In addition to movement, light exposure (on the wrist) was also recorded.
